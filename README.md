## 📘 Project Overview

### Objective
This project demonstrates an end-to-end AI system that combines modern RAG architecture with production-ready machine learning models to extract actionable insights from business data. The system enables organizations to make faster, data-driven decisions through natural language queries and predictive analytics.

### Business Problem
Many organizations struggle with:
- **Information Overload**: Critical insights buried in lengthy business documents
- **Manual Analysis**: Time-consuming manual report reviews and data analysis
- **Reactive Decision Making**: Lack of predictive insights for customer churn and sales trends
- **Fragmented Tools**: Separate systems for document search, ML analytics, and reporting

### Goal
Build an intelligent system that:
- Enables natural language queries across business documents
- Provides AI-driven insights through predictive models
- Automates customer segmentation and churn risk assessment
- Delivers accurate sales forecasts for resource planning
- Runs entirely on free, open-source technology stack
